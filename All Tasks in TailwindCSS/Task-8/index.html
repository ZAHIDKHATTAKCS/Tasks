    <p>
        we can costumize the main tailwindcss config file and if we want to add some custom values just like the
        tailwindcss having no class of mx-13 if we want to add it to our tailwindcss we can do it by using it's full
        config file in order to do that first of all we have to download the full config file of tailwindcss from the
        google simplly search on google for tailwindcss configuration click on first link and scroll down a while you
        will find a code like that <br><br><br>

    </p>

    <!-- Image 1 -->
    <div class="flex">
        <li>1</li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <a href="img1.html" target="_blank">
            <img src="includes/images/1.png" alt="code image" class="w-96">
        </a>
    </div><br><br>


    <!-- Image 2 -->
    <div class="flex">
        <li>2</li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <a href="img2.html" target="_blank">
            <img src="includes/images/2.png" alt="code image" class="w-96">
        </a>
    </div><br><br>

    <code class="mx-96">
            npx tailwindcss init --full <br><br><br>
            
        </code>
    you have to copy it and just simple run it in vscode like npx tailwindcss init "here you have to add the name for
    that file which store all the predefine code of tailwindcss" <br><br><br>


    <br>


    <!-- Image 3 -->
    <div class="flex">
        <li>3</li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <a href="img3.html" target="_blank">
            <img src="includes/images/3.png" alt="code image" class="w-96">
        </a>
    </div><br><br>

    when you hit enter this will create a file named that you enter earlier you have to open it,
    <img src="" alt=""> <br>

    <!-- Image 4 -->
    <div class="flex">
        <li>4</li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <a href="img4.html" target="_blank">
            <img src="includes/images/4 after hit enter.png" alt="code image" class="w-96">
        </a>
    </div><br><br>

    <p>
        when you open it this will show you all the classes that are predefined in the tailwindcss as I earler mentioned
        that tailwindcss having no class of text-10xl or font-size-13px in order to add that you have to find where is
        the place in which all the classes of fontsize are placed just follow it's path when you find it copy one of the
        given code like that
    </p><br><br><br>

    <!-- Image 5 -->
    <div class="flex">
        <li>5</li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <a href="img5.html" target="_blank">
            <img src="includes/images/5.png" alt="code image" class="w-96">
        </a>
    </div><br><br>

    <p>

        and you have to paste it in the official tailwind.config.js file in extend property and follow the same path
        that is defined in the full file that we download from google like that <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <!-- Image 6 -->
    <div class="flex">
        <li>6</li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <a href="img6.html" target="_blank">
            <img src="includes/images/6.png" alt="code image" class="w-96">
        </a>
    </div><br><br>





    <p>
        The given text zahid khattak is from that class that we recently create.
    </p>
    <div class="text-10xl">
        zahid khattak
    </div>

    <p>
        This is all about how can we add the custom values and sizes in the tailwindcss 
    </p>
